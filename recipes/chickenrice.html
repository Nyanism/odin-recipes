          <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>To clean the chicken, rub all over with a handful of salt, getting
                rid of any loose skin. Rinse the chicken well inside and out. Pat dry
                with paper towels.
              </li>
              <li>Remove any excess fat from the chicken and set aside for later.</li>
              <li>Season the chicken generously with salt. Stuff the chicken cavity
                with the ginger slices and scallions.
              </li>
              <li>Place the chicken in a large stock pot, cover with cold water by 2 cm,
                and season with salt to taste.
              </li>
              <li>Bring to boil over high heat, then immediately reduce the heat to
                low to maintain a simmer. Cover and cook for about 30 minutes, or until
                the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 75°C. Remove the pot
                from the heat.
              </li>
              <li>Remove the chicken from the pot, reserving the poaching liquid for
                later, and transfer to an ice bath for 5 minutes to stop the cooking
                process and to keep the chicken skin springy. Discard the ginger and 
                green onion.
              </li>
              <li>After it's cooled, pat the chicken dry with paper towels and rub
                all over with sesame oil. This will help prevent the chicken from drying 
                out.
              </li>
              <li>In a large wok or skillet, heat ¼ cup of sesame oil over medium-high
                heat. Add 2 tablespoons of reserved chopped chicken fat, the garlic, ginger
                and salt, and fry until aromatic, about 10 minutes.
              </li>
              <li>Reserve ¼ of the fried garlic mixture, then add the rice to the remaining
                fried garlic and stir to coat. Cook for 3 minutes.
              </li>
              <li>Transfer the rice to a rice cooker and add 2 cups of reserved poaching
                broth. Steam the rice for 60 minutes, or until tender.
              </li>
              <li>While the rice is cooking, carve the chicken for serving.</li>
              <li>Make the chilli sauce: combine the sambal, sriracha, sugar, garlic, ginger,
                lime juice, and chicken broth in a small bowl and stir to incorporate.
              </li>
              <li>Make the ginger garlic sauce: in a small bowl, combine the ginger, garlic,
                salt, peanut oil and rice vinegar, and stir to incorporate.
              </li>
              <li>Make the soy sauce: in a small bowl, combine the reserved fried garlic and
              ginger with the oyster sauce, dark soy sauce, light soy sauce, and chicken broth,
              and stir to incorporate.
              </li>
              <li>Serve the sliced chicken with the rice, dipping sauces, sliced cucumbers,
                and fresh cilantro.
              </li>
              <li>Enjoy!</li>
